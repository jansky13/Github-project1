## Stoplights
### This piece I made was a stoplight with different colors. When the mouse was clicked one circle would change color and if the space key was pressed another circle would change color.

## Snowfall
### This piece was something I struggled with including putting in loops at the time. This piece was a cityscape with falling snow at the start of the page. Featuring a background of the night sky and moon.

## Space 
### Space was one of my first pieces that I made. It consisted of a ship flying through astreoids and planets. I based it off the look of asteroids the retro video game.
